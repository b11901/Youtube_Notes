# Youtube-Notes
The idea of this site is to allow users to watch YouTube videos and take note at the same time.

This is the initial working version of the app that I found in my backup and this needs a lot of changes. So guys always use GitHub to back your files. If you are free and would like to help me I would love if you would contribute to this project.

Current Priorities:
[ ] Design the Note writing app.
[ ] Add styling to the video_player page
[ ] Add a home page for the users to see all of their Notes.
